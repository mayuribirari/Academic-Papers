"I'm black, I also run a blog with a focus on police misconduct. I have zero confidence in BLM as a group for numerous reasons including the Orlando vigil video, the Toronto Pride demands, and the obnoxiousness of most of their protests (remember invading ""white spaces""?). But my biggest problem with BLM is that they treat police brutality like a problem of racism and while racism can explain some of it, excessive police power is the greater issue.

People don't know the names Kelly Thomas, Daniel Chong, and Michael Bell. People don't know the 8 year old girl that police tazed because she had a tantrum while holding a paring knife. We don't hear about Deven Guilford or Bou Phonesavanh. The list of non-black victims of the low bar for legally-acceptable use of force by police goes on. In the Chong case, he was locked in an interrogation room for days without food or water. He's received a nice settlement check, but the officers who left him there got a slap on the wrist.

Make no mistake, police killings of blacks are disproportionate to our part of the population. But the larger problem is militarized police, no-knock raids, and blind trust in police both on a citizen level and within the criminal justice system. 

The fact that police can accidentally shoot people and call their union rep before the paramedics and suffer little to no consequences is crazy. The fact that officers have a day to get their story straight after a shooting is crazy. Grand juries indict nearly 100% of the cases brought before them; when it comes to police, they are rarely ever indicted.

By focusing on race, BLM misses the point and also pushes away allies who could be convinced on other issues. I don't blame them for being so angry and moving off of emotion. History tells us that police target blacks and the media stokes those fears for their own benefit. I wish BLM was a group I could get behind, but in their present form, they're severely lacking.

Edit: I really appreciate the response and the gildings, guys. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I want to use this bit of attention to say this: talk to your friends and family about police misconduct. These conversations are hard, but they are necessary. Speak about black victims, white victims, and all others, please use your voice to speak up. I won't be sharing my blog, while I could use the extra readership, I'd rather keep the two separate. I do think everyone who's interested in knowing more than what the media reports on police misconduct should head over to http://www.policemisconduct.net/ for more information on police abuse of power and look over the ACLU's writings on asset forfeiture abuse, police corruption, and militarization: https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police-practices/police-excessive-force","Im black I also run a blog with a focus on police misconduct I have zero confidence in BLM as a group for numerous reasons including the Orlando vigil video the Toronto Pride demands and the obnoxiousness of most of their protests remember invading white spaces But my biggest problem with BLM is that they treat police brutality like a problem of racism and while racism can explain some of it excessive police power is the greater issue

"This is an absolutely wonderful post and succinctly illustrates a very complex problem.

The racial disproportionality is a symptom of discretionary police overreach and vague legal criteria for what constitutes a ""good"" shooting.

Very small tweaks to the existing procedure could make horrible acts of violence against citizens currently ""good"" policing bad policing and would go miles.

BLM recently release a core group of 10 principles they want to have addressed but nowhere was there a change to the existing criteria of acceptable use of force or even change to what must take place after an officer fires his weapon.

Having some direction is a good change, but it seems to be about treating symptoms rather than root causes.","This is an absolutely wonderful post and succinctly illustrates a very complex problem

"I gilded you in hopes of making this post more visible. Would you mind elaborating on why you think the primary issue here is excessive police force going unchecked, and race is a *secondary* issue? My girlfriend and I argue about this all the time, but I imagine since you write on the topic regularly you could shed some light for both of us. I'm white and she's mixed latina and white. 

To her, police brutality disproportionately affecting black people is just a symptom of the larger problem of systemic racism we have in the U.S., and that that's what needs to be addressed. It seems to me that, although racism is clearly a problem with police, the issue is that cops can enforce their biases with essentially no consequences. People will always be racist, we just need to have a system that holds them accountable, like we have for employers/employees. If you could magically fix the racism in society, police would still misbehave without consequences; if you could magically fix the accountability issue in our justice system, the racist actions would begin to be curbed. It comes down, I think, to how exclusive of an issue violent, excessive police force is to black people, as opposed to one that affects everybody.

"A lot of autistic people wind up dead after police contacts too. The approach that police officers take can come across as extremely threatening. Throw a mentally disabled person into the mix, in the middle of an episode, and you're going to have problems. Not making eye contact, not responding as expected or at all for non-verbals, physically resisting when unexpectedly touched. Not making the right facial expressions or the correct body language. Really, the problem isn't *just* race. The cops can get away with murder under all kinds of circumstances.

Here's one: (Granted, this autistic man was *also* black on top of it. Double whammy.)

> In the case of Steven Eugene Washington, nothing more than a blank stare made him a target for police bullets. Two Los Angeles Police Department officers, Allan Corrales and George Diego, fired on the 27-year-old man with autism on March 20, 2010. The officers saw Washington walking alone with a “blank stare,” according to the account of one of the cops given in an internal investigation report. They apparently took that as a sign of suspicious activity, even though that can be a hallmark of people on the autism spectrum. When Washington reached into his waistband, the LAPD officers shot him in the head. Washington, it turns out, was reaching for his cellphone.

Not only did those cops not get charged, they got $2 million each.

"There are two different main crime reports, one is the UCR which is compiled by the FBI based on reports from local enforcement agencies. For example say Podunk PDs officer Friendly thinks that his towns frequency of rape is too high, he might start marking down rapes as sexual misconducts to change that appearance. In the same way he might look the other way in a white neighborhood which increases feelings of safety for those people because they don't 'see' the crime 'happening' aka it wasn't reported.

The NCVS is a survey based reporting system that collects data from representative samples and extrapolates from there. This means that it is a self report system so it has, as an example, the flaw of a given person not reporting a crime maybe to protect a family member or perhaps because they themselves committed the crime and don't report that.

It's important to have data like this but it's more important to know where it comes from. Broken Windows policing and it's metastatic cousin the ""stop and frisk"" mean that minorities have been and are more prone to police scrutiny due to socioeconomic factors as well as racial factors. Consider that surveying shows that white people sell and use drugs at higher numbers (not sure about ratio rates on that) yet black people are arrested, convicted, jailed at higher rates and often with harsher sentencing for similar crimes.

She noted that many of the cases we're seeing and reading about are actually not in line with the community policing model many departments ascribe to.

"It's not necessarily police departments giving preference, it's the state's civil service exam structure that propels former military to the top of the list.  You can get up to 10 points on your test (typically - here in MA I think you can get up to 15) if you meet eligibility. That propels people over HUNDREDS of candidates.  In Massachusetts, your rank on the list is determined by the lowest number.

"Yep here in CT I have taken three written exams so far. One general one, and two for specific departments that wanted to conduct their own additional exam. Each exam had a question asking about military background. I got a 78 on the general, an 86 on my hometown department's exam, and a 93 on another department's. I also think extra consideration is given based on where you live, with obviously being a resident of that city/town being a major bonus. When I went to the one for my hometown, I saw license plates from NY and NJ despite not living near those states as far as within CT goes. So it sucks knowing that those people from out of state who know nothing about my home town, might be preferred over me. I came in third place out of 167 applicants and I can't help but hope anyone who may have earned veteran's points is way below me.

"Too true. Boy racers tend to drive cheaper cars than Imprezas or Evos, those sort of cars are way too expensive to own and insure unless the parents are minted.

Most of them will be driving whatever they can afford to insure, usually a small hatchback like a Renault Clio.

The more adventurous ones will attempt dubious modifications such as DIY body kits or (even more sketchy) lowered suspension. None of this will improve the performance of the car.

"Canadian cops get a lot of the same sort of training. That was why the Black Lives Matter comments about the RCMP were so ludicrous. Municipal cops sometimes have problems with profiling and power trips, but the RCMP has been exemplary recently. Not perfect of course, but clearly working to correct any errors that they do make. And basically none of them shoot first.

Myself and another friend have had some profiling problems as teenagers or young men with long hair, where cops have decided to bug us for no reason at all. But there's never a feeling of danger. The worst you might get is a trip to the drunk tank. Maybe you get pepper sprayed, tasered, or hit with a baton if you are stupid enough to actually threaten or attack the cop. Killed? Not a chance.

The officers in my town have shot one person in the last year and he was not killed because the officer aimed low and only shot three times. This person was brandishing a realistic-looking pellet gun, had a knife out, and was threatening the officers. The officer waited until the person came at him and got within 15 metres before firing. That is the level things got to before lethal force came into it.

And here's the crazy thing. Canada has a lot of guns compared to a place like the UK (per capita). Less than half the amount of the US, but way more than anywhere in Europe other than Finland. And yet, compared to the US, our gun crime rate is low and our police shoot much more rarely. That's partially because we're more rural and we have different and somewhat fewer economic and racial inequality problems. But it's also due to our attitudes around guns (a tool for hunting or the absolute last resort for defense), our focus on firearm registration, and the different training of our law enforcement officers.

"Well, in the US unless you are the victim of a crime there is literally nothing a cop will do to make things easier for you.

""If you have any drugs on you, just surrender them now and I'll go easy on you.""

If you voluntarily surrender it, you get the exact same punishment as if you made them come up with a reason to search you and find it themselves.

So yeah, it is 110% worth it to attempt to end any encounter with the police ASAP.  Ask if you are being detained, don't consent to any searches, don't agree to do anything you aren't legally obligated to do.

Plus, even if you don't have anything in your car illegal, there's nothing to stop them from tearing your car to pieces.

You can only lose in an encounter with the police.  Your best bet is to make it seem like it's not worth their time.","Well in the US unless you are the victim of a crime there is literally nothing a cop will do to make things easier for you

I think a lot of these police who are killing black men, at the conscious level are not racist. But, subconsciously, like the people who clutch their purse, have biases; This is obviously super fucking dangerous in their profession.

Now-a-days people don't default to the assumption that people deserve respect. Like . . . authority figures are given disrespect from the start until they earn respect.

That automatic disrespect (of teachers, minorities, neighbors, police officers) is what breeds bitter, nasty authority figures to begin with. Then it becomes a feedback loop.

"BLM has completely misunderstood the entire idea of how nonviolent protests work, and why some are more successful than others. The entire concept of nonviolent civil disobedience revolves around publicly doing things that *should* be allowed, but for whatever reason are not. For instance, people are drawing comparisons to the sit-ins of the Civil Rights movement. Let's examine that, shall we? 

The sit-ins and other methods employed by the Civil Rights movement protested segregation by purposefully violating the laws enforcing it. They *specifically* limited their targets to places of segregation, such as diners, public buses, etc. By doing so, they successfully demonstrated the injustice of the laws by getting arrested for doing something innocuous like sitting in a restaurant. When the public at large sees people being unjustly punished like that, they usually sympathize with the protester and side with their cause.

In contrast, BLM does *not* work this way. Blocking off a highway is just an indiscriminate act of obstruction, not a targeted protest. There's no message there except a clamoring for attention; instead of highlighting the actual problem, BLM simply makes noise by fucking over a bunch random strangers, most of whom probably *weren't* their enemies to begin with. Their tactics are more tantrum than protest. If you want people the on the sidelines to join your fight, poking them in the eye is the absolute worst way to do it. Sure, they're *aware* of you now, but instead of they hate you for being a dick.

"To add to what /u/AtlasTranscended said, another thing I've heard is the tactic is simply to impact people to force them to listen.

There are others that say that racism actually isn't a thing anymore because legally blacks and whites have the same rights, and claim things like institutional racism or systemic injustices are symptoms of things like blacks not trying hard enough, etc.

So the goal of blocking highways and the like is really to grab people's eyes and ears and try to force them to hear the message.

"I haven't personally found that to be the case, but I haven't met everyone. I don't think it's necessarily fair to say that people can't have fun at a protest, especially with friends in a peaceful protest. Also, selfies saying you're at the protest are a way of showing support and spreading the word on social media. In either case, even if what you're saying is true, it doesn't make the intentions or goals wrong.

Unfortunately though, among most of the blacks I know, there is genuine terror of what might happen and frustration that nothing has changed to fix it. I also know among my closest black friends that they don't often talk about things like this because it leads to nothing but frustration for them, so it is possible many are hiding their true feelings.  I think there's many different motivations and emotions, as is the case in any grassroots movement.

That being said, yes, any loss of life as a result of the actions is inexcusable. We should be outraged. And we should be outraged at the loss of life of every black person as a result of the excessive use of force by police officers. I think there isn't that (at least across the whole population, there is plenty of outrage, but in certain communities). I don't think their goal is to kill anyone, though. In fact, how some people freak out to blocking ambulances but not for the lives of the men murdered actually accentuates their point. People only care when it affects them, and for many white people, this issue doesn't really affect them.

What good is it trying to tell someone something they don't want or care to hear?  That's irrational to me.  You can't annoy someone to reason.

Ask yourself, how much of a jerk would you be to hear ""**Blue** lives matter!"" and respond with ""All lives matter!""?  Someone speaks up about bad cops killing blacks and there's a common response about blacks killing blacks.  Someone shows a videos of bad cops irrationally escalating situations, then killing a black man, and the common response is something about not being able to completely see something in the video to know for sure.  It's any and everything to get away from the subject at hand which makes people uncomfortable.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm pretty sure this is really cognitive dissonance.

"I'm black, I live in a City with relatively little crime (Austin,TX).

I love the passion of BLM and I think they've done a great job of forcing people to have the conversation. But I have to agree with bigbear on some points.

We as black people know that there's racism in policing, there always has been. BUT if you frame it SOLELY a racial issue (which it is not) you open the door for the ""black people are committing all the crimes"" counter-argument. 

This is less about race and more about the fact the police think they can do whatever they want. Now here's where it starts to get interesting. I will say that's it's my observation that a white people is LESS likely to question a police shooting of another white person, unless of course it's family. 

So what you end up with is a police force that essentially has free reign to do what they want, while we argue about who commits more crimes. 

""The media doesn't report when white officers are shot!"" Okay, well who controls the media? It certainly isn't people of color. 

Last year 700+ white people were killed by police. That makes me angry. That should make everybody angry. But how many times have we seen white people mobilize in numbers for a white person that was shot by a cop? I would imagine it's pretty rare. Not to say it's never happened, but again, it's probably not the most common thing. It seems as though the only time white people care about other white people being shot by cops is to try to discredit black people. That seems counter-intuitive. Especially when most of the people speaking on ""The tyranny of the government"" are usually white. I'm not sure what illustrates that better than an agent of the state shooting unarmed civilians. 

I'd like to address the idea that the black community idolizes negative imagery and culture. As much as this is true, I think this can be said for America as a whole. Americans are fascinated  outlaws, mafia dons, hitmen, serial killers, murderers, drug dealers, etc. To frame that as something exclusive to the black community  is disingenuous IMO.

TLDR; I'm ok with BLM, but I wish it was less of a racial narrative. Makes it too easy to ignore and explain away. White people need to start actively challenging the police when a white person (especially unarmed) is killed. Black Americans love gangster shit because America loves gangster shit.

"Honestly, this sort of thread just upvotes the thinly veiled racism that's prevalent all throughout Reddit. People in their 20's and up hate how baby boomers talk about lifting yourself up by the bootstraps but absolutely eat it up when people of color come into this thread and talk about doing the same thing to get away from their dangerous neighborhoods. 


I understand, white people are alienated by civil rights groups when they say phrases like ""Black Lives Matter"", because to them it's like saying that black lives are more important than any other race. I think it's pretty stupid when people of color say things like reverse racism doesn't exist because racism comes from a position of power, because they're just changing the definition of an already established word (racism) to fit their agenda. However, the point of the movement is to highlight the mistreatment of black people in this country. 


If you truly believe that all races are equal but then parrot statistics like black males only make up 7% of the population but still commit x% of y crimes, then what exactly is the implication here? It's easy to look from the outside and think, ""Oh those black thugs, their entire culture is based around violence, drugs, misogyny, etc."" When you look deeper you'll understand that the groundwork that a segregated America from a few short decades ago did to a people who have been unvalued for the entirety of their existence in the United States. I'm not going to excuse the actions of these people in any way, but the root of their problem is systemic. 


It's easy to say things like, ""All lives matter!"" when you've never had to face the issues that people of color in this country have had to. I'm a brown guy so some of my issues are similar to that of black people (anyone past a certain skin tone is apparently a criminal?), but most of the racial issues I face are attributed to how people feel about Muslim terrorists, despite the fact that I'm an Indian Christian.


While the BLM movement has extremely major faults, and I can't say for sure whether they're helping or hurting their cause, change needs to be made. Funding education, and after school programs for impoverished neighborhoods. Free childcare for women in these neighborhoods who have young children. Changes in infrastructure in these communities to give people jobs in their neighborhoods. That kind of supports needs unity from the white community, so while I identify with the anger of the BLM activists, yelling about how white cops should die and violence isn't going to cause policy change.


EDIT: Quick aside don't down vote anyone with dissenting opinions. I know people are messaging me as if I'm accusing white people as a whole of hating POC or something when in reality I'm trying to help them understand how our point of view differs.

"People interpret the academic racism terms very poorly. 

By saying black people can't be racist based on the definition, you are only confusing or pissing the common person off. It may be useful in an academic sense, but we need to stop presenting this as an argument. 

I'm also assuming many people in these threads don't understand that white people can be a minority in their community. When that is the case, white people can face academic-defined racism. In an 80% black community, you can almost guarantee it will be harder to find jobs and you will experience discrimination because you are the ""outsider"" in the community. 

Also if we go by systemic racism's academic definition, then it doesn't exist today. There are no written laws that disparage black people. What we have is social racism and remnants of past systemic racism. But that sounds stupid and just confuses and angers people again. 

On average, I think most Americans will agree that black people experience more racism/discrimination than white people. Why can't we just acknowledge that racism affects everyone, but usually is more hurtful to black people? That would make it a lot easier to get empathy from non-black people.

By saying black people cant be racist based on the definition you are only confusing or pissing the common person off It may be useful in an academic sense but we need to stop presenting this as an argument 

Im also assuming many people in these threads dont understand that white people can be a minority in their community When that is the case white people can face academicdefined racism In an 80 black community you can almost guarantee it will be harder to find jobs and you will experience discrimination because you are the outsider in the community 

Also if we go by systemic racisms academic definition then it doesnt exist today There are no written laws that disparage black people What we have is social racism and remnants of past systemic racism But that sounds stupid and just confuses and angers people again 

On average I think most Americans will agree that black people experience more racismdiscrimination than white people Why cant we just acknowledge that racism affects everyone but usually is more hurtful to black people That would make it a lot easier to get empathy from nonblack people ",5,4,0.005,0.01

"As a black person, African-American, Person of Color or whatever else you wanna call me, I can honestly say BLM doesn't care about black lives for three reasons.

The first is they only care when it's a black person is getting shot by the cops. If it's black-on-black crime BLM is silent. Where were the riots for Jamyla Bolden? Tyshawn Lee? Jajuan Latham? That's right didn't think so. The largest threat to black people is other black people as shown by FBI crime statistics in [2013](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_6_murder_race_and_sex_of_vicitm_by_race_and_sex_of_offender_2013.xls) and [2014](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/expanded-homicide-data/expanded_homicide_data_table_6_murder_race_and_sex_of_vicitm_by_race_and_sex_of_offender_2014.xls). While there is a growing problem with [police brutality](http://www.killedbypolice.net/) the issue is not exclusive to black people. The source I used for police brutality is likely the best source available currently but it doesn't account for non fatal police shootings and in approximately 20% of cases it doesn't identify the victim completely.

My next point is that BLM in many cases advocates violence against police and is hostile towards white people. When people attack police (who are human beings, yes it is surprising) it compromises their safety as well as the safety of all the innocent people that the police are supposed to protect. A great number of posters on reddit believe that only white people can be racist but showing hostility towards a specific group of people for something they can not PHYSICALLY control seems awfully bigoted. Besides didn't the mothers of BLM ever tell them that ""violence breeds violence?""

Third and final point because I feel like I've gone on too long and nobody is going to read this far before downvoting; BLM antagonizes it's own allies. They stopped a gay pride parade in [Toronto](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-kirchick-gay-pride-black-lives-matter-20160705-snap-story.html) for 30 minutes not to talk about how BLM is a proud supporter of gay pride, how gays and black might have some similar ongoing issues, but about how black gays and queers specifically were treated. Let's not forget what happened to [Bernie Sanders] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV-ZSP0zAuI).

"Black guy here. I agree with the messages that black lives matter. It's just that anybody can associate with it and do something to degrade the entire movement.

I think most people with a decent level of intelligence would know that Black Lives Matter basically means Black Lives Matter, too.

"I love it.

I am a 24 years old. College graduate. Homeowner. I come from a low-income household - I moved more times before the age of 18 than most people move in their lifetimes. I have done everything that I was ""supposed"" to in order to better my life for my family and myself, and yet, I am still afraid. Every day that I leave for work, I feel anxiety about the drive. Every day that I leave work to go home, I feel anxiety. Every time that I see a cop car in my general vicinity, I fear that if I fit a description this might be the day that I'm unjustly arrested, beaten/shot, or worse. I'm no stranger to police, either. A number of family members have had run ins with the law, and I had truancy issues in the past. I've had police officers ""pop out"" on me, accuse me of being in a gang for wearing a color-coordinated outfit, threaten to arrest me, and fulfill every other stereotype out there. I've also had police officers give me some of the best advice I've ever been given, protect me, and some of my friends have gone on to work in the criminal justice system. 

I'm glad that Black Lives Matter is a movement. For me, it serves as a constant reminder of the many contributions that black people have made to this country, only for those contributions to not be acknowledged or even stolen. It serves as a reminder for the many black people who have been unjustly killed and who have had their lives irreversibly affected by the criminal justice system. It serves as a reminder that regardless of how much America says we've progressed, we're far closer to the past than we realize. It reminds me that my life does matter, despite how much I fear that it does not, and seeing it on such a grand stage makes me hopeful that we can convince everyone else that our lives matter.","I love it

"Professional Black Guy Reporting (over 20 year full time experience being black)

While I do have issues with some of the execution and ideas, I think the movement is inevitable. For decades black people have been saying this is what is going on and no one has listened. We have been talking reasonably and the system has failed us repeatedly and consistently.

With the new generation. Trayvon Martin and subsequent incidents was the thing that sparked it but not for the reasons the ""What about black on black crime"" crowd think. We are well aware that we live in a world where awful things happen and people are killed for several horrible reasons including race. This is not news to black people.

What sparks the anger is that the justice system turns a blind eye. Zimmer man was never even going to go to court for what he had done until people started protesting. Likewise in several other incidents. People died and the killer went about their life like nothing happened. 

That's what black people feel that black lives don't matter in America. We can be killed and the system that claims to be just does not care. With some of the incidents, we have had to go on the killers word alone and from their sometimes dubious testimony, they were allowed to walk. However, now we have video of police killing children, or killing people with no provocation and the justice system lets it go. How can people be not be furious?

If you really want to stop black lives matter from doing what they are doing, then provide an equally or more effective means for issues to be heard and addressed fairly. The courts have failed, the system has failed. 

And please do not quote MLK's ""I have a dream"" to me. Status quo preserving people love that speech because dreams are not made of anything. They have no deadlines, no requirements, no substance. They won't quote this MLK

"BLM, to me as a black man living in Baltimore, is necessary. The willful ignorance of white people that I see DAILY confirms, to me, that BLM is necessary.  However, I do feel they are rudderless in planning and execution.  However, that has always been the case with most black movements in this country, starting with the NAACP. Most of these movements, organizations, etc. are not led correctly.  In all honesty, would you want your civil rights organization, the group fighting for equal treatment, to be run by figureheads like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton?

I am also very cynical, so I don't feel that BLM will get anywhere. From what I have seen, read, and experienced, those in power in this country have been doing everything they can to undermine what BLM stands for, with the racist rhetoric of #AllLivesMatter and #BlueLivesMatter, to personalities like Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani, to media groups that only exist to sell themselves, like CNN and Fox News (even MSNBC has gone of the deep end at times).  Everything in this country is geared towards keeping rich white men rich and in power, while marginalizing everyone else. EVERYTHING. Police are killing black people in the streets with impunity. But don't forget that there is legislature against the LGBT, de-funding of Planned Parenthood and laws to make abortion a CRIME.  Everyone is marginalized EXCEPT for rich white men. Poor white people are looked down upon just as much as blacks, mexicans, asians, those from the middle east, whomever.  BLM is just another response to the same atrocities we have been dealing with since the inception of this country.  40 years from now (probably sooner), there will be another group to voice their displeasure as to where this country is headed, and they will be snuffed out all the same.

"The most interesting part of the whole thing is how divisive the issue can be. BLM is mainly about the Black Community, and I'm not denying that others also have problems but that there are real issues with discrimination against Black People. Here's the key argument though -- BLACK people and issues related to them. Every other argument is a real strawman -- whether intentional or not they tend to lead you away from the point. The issues aren't new either, that's also why they can be so divisive since we've seen them since this country's creation. No different than the women's equality movement, we're just looking to be equals, not better or worse, just equals. BLM isn't perfect, neither was the movement behind MLK and Malcom X (Little), but if one thing they're showing the world just how real this issues still are in America. Their will always be extremists in any real group, and that's what I think people get hooked in to.

You have MLK, of course, and his doctorate of peaceful protest and unity with all men and how we should see everyone as brothers and sisters. Yet, the BLM movement has consistently brought violence and segregation wherever they've protested. Attacking white protestors, interrupting Bernie and the Gay Pride Parade, basically saying to all groups we are more important and will stop all forms of social progress until our demands are met. 


But that isn't how it works, you have to join with those who are experiencing similar discrimination as you, not drive a wedge between you and them. Honestly the BLM movement is the most cancerous disgraceful thing for the black community and clearly highlights problems that are within the community that have to be taken care of. This isn't to say that the black community isn't facing heavy discrimination and prejudice, but for some reason the BLM movement seems to think it's only blacks who are facing this and do not care about anyone else.


The biggest thing is that I think it's cowardly what they are doing. It's cowardly to break up Pride, because you know that Gay people are unlikely to publicly criticize you, it's cowardly to overrun the speech of the one man who has been on the ground fighting for your civil rights for his entire life. It's probably the most self-centered and despicable thing you can do to literally plan to try and have martial law declared because you want your crown jewel (Obama) to stay in office rather than bettering yourselves and admitting that you, just like the rest of America, have to sit down and compromise instead of whining and crying like a little baby because you didn't get your way.


I am proud of black history and the many great people who have fought for civil rights and the hardships we've overcome to get here. We have so many amazing cultural and societal achievements that we should be proud of. But, when so many blacks are constantly getting involved with gangs, and returning to prison over and over again, when the number of blacks killing blacks in the last ten years is almost on par with the deaths in Iraq, and when the leaders of this movement can only see the world in an us or them view there is a huge problem with the culture that you're representing and that is all focused and put into a single point with BLM.","I think its important for a movement to be happening but its almost as if those who are running the movement are not looking to solve the problem theyre just embarrassing black people and forgetting what so many civil rights leaders in the past have fought but more than that they are forgetting the way things were fought for

I am proud of black history and the many great people who have fought for civil rights and the hardships weve overcome to get here We have so many amazing cultural and societal achievements that we should be proud of But when so many blacks are constantly getting involved with gangs and returning to prison over and over again when the number of blacks killing blacks in the last ten years is almost on par with the deaths in Iraq and when the leaders of this movement can only see the world in an us or them view there is a huge problem with the culture that youre representing and that is all focused and put into a single point with BLM",5,7,0.01276595744680851,0.01702127659574468

"I think the root cause that the movement wants to promote is very valid.  Similar to feminism however, I think that the most radical, controversial, and downright criminal activities of some individuals gets the most attention and is disproportionately magnified.  We forget how big this country is and just how many people can rally behind a point.  We're talking thousands of people who can support something peacefully, but if a few dozen do something to garner negative recognition, people will jump to invalidate the whole cause.

This movement started as a hashtag that people picked up and projected a lot of their own intention on.  Sure the core problem being addressed might be the same, but literally anyone can start up an organization and claim that it is affiliated with BLM.  Things such as local poverty/wealth distribution and relationship with the police and governing bodies in that area will greatly affect the magnitude and severity of actions that members of the movements in those areas will seek.  I live in an area  that is not as heavily segregated as many others, and people in general or more willing to be familial towards one another if given the opportunity regardless of race for the most part.  However, I understand that in many places this sense of community is not often extended across racial boundaries, and in places like that tensions are much higher.  It's easy for me to say that some people need to calm down and take a more rational approach, but the truth is I don't know their day to day situation.  They could be at the end of their rope with absolutely no realistic way to improve their situation, and just completely fed up with how they and their family have been treated.

One thing I have distinctly noted and laugh at though is how we romanticize our country's own past in terms of government rebellion, yet completely fail to see parallels with what's going on today.  We say things like ""they should be peaceful, there's no need for this destruction"", yet we have a sense of pride when taught about things like the Boston Tea Party.  I feel like at that point the British was saying very similar things to what we hear now.  ""They should be more diplomatic.  There are channels by which they can address this without resorting to breaking the law"".   Equality and freedom was never acquired at the convenience of those in power, never has been, and the fact that people feign indignation about what's going on now is kind of ridiculous.


Finally, I in no way condone the actions of the individual in Dallas.  It was disgusting, and did absolutely nothing to paint the movement in any positive light.  The shooter clearly displayed the same type of racist disregard for life that  the movement is trying to fight.  ""oh you're [this color], that means that you are less than human to me""  Now people, most likely very good people are walking around with the pain that a loved one was killed for something that they didn't do. But then again, doesn't that sound almost exactly what the families of the hundreds of black individuals are feeling too?  The hurt goes both ways, and it's sad, but it almost seems like pain is the only thing that has come close to bringing people together.  I think we're getting to a tipping point where people on both sides are saying enough is enough.   The key distinction though is that the man who killed those police officers was literally blown to shit.  Many of the cops who many agree prematurely used deadly force face almost no disciplinary action.  There are wackos on both sides, and this complete resistance to admitting it is what is the most frustrating.

 **tl;dr The movement in and of itself exists to highlight a very real problem. However, the size of the United States population and the disproportional highlighting of the actions of a few serve to warp the perspective to the general public (not accidentally I would argue).  No centralized or unifying documentation or official mission statement allows anyone to project their own agendas onto the hashtag cause.  There are complete nut jobs on both sides, yet it continually seems like one side is more swiftly and fatally punished than another. Some people turn it into a he hit me first type of discussion with no interest in compromise, and we all seem to forget that no fight for equality was completely done without some form of social upheaval** ","I think the root cause that the movement wants to promote is very valid  Similar to feminism however I think that the most radical controversial and downright criminal activities of some individuals gets the most attention and is disproportionately magnified  We forget how big this country is and just how many people can rally behind a point  Were talking thousands of people who can support something peacefully but if a few dozen do something to garner negative recognition people will jump to invalidate the whole cause

">>Anything with the name ""black"" in it automatically divides the cause by race.

>Why though

It's kind of tautological. Using the word ""black"" means you are making a racial distinction, which by definition makes it racially divided.

But I get what you mean, as well. 

By omission, you're saying it's more important to focus on the deaths of black people than on anyone else. If a cop kills 3 asian people and 6 black people, obviously you expect more of an outcry if a 7th black person is killed. It looks skewed, or biased. But you are *by omission* ignoring the 3 asian people that were also killed in identical circumstances.

Which is fine. No one's saying it's racist or whatever. Are you allowed to focus on whoever you want? Of course. If you want to focus on black people being killed by police, go ahead. But it's important to be honest with yourself -- you technically aren't protesting police brutality, you are protesting police brutality against black people.","Anything with the name black in it automatically divides the cause by race

As a black woman, if I tell anyone that I support ""All Lives Matter"" as opposed to ""Black Lives Matter,"" I'd be told I'm no better than the white people. That I'm a whitey lover. That I don't care about my own people and I've been brainwashed by white supremacy.

I also care for the white kid who was tazed into permanent brain damage by another cop. Just for attempting to comply.

What *matters* is police brutality. If someone who's white, latino, or otherwise non-black, it goes unreported by the media, and you might see it on smaller news sites. That's it. But if a black person is the victim? Oh, shit, hell breaks loose. Cries of ""They're hunting us."" Marches.

Why aren't we talking about how the standards for being a cop should be raised? Someone who's going to fire four rounds into a parked car is not someone who should be a cop.

If you have to turn off your camera to do your job, what does that say about you? Goes without saying that if you're trying to be sneaky, your intentions likely aren't good.

If get stopped, ignore the commands of the police, make a sudden move that implies or actualizes aggression or danger towards the police and get shot, that's MY fault. It's not an issue of race, it's the consequences of my choice to not comply with the police and consequently threaten their safety. I made a choice, I MUST accept the consequences. 

Each of us make a conscious choice every moment to either live within the law or outside of the law.

By teaching our children that they should live outside the law and don't have to respect authority, we must fully accept the consequences of that choice, up to and including their death. 

We MUST follow the law. If we don't like the law, we must follow the proper channels to get that law changed. Doing whatever the hell we want and blaming the consequences on lawmakers and police officers who are doing their jobs is not acceptable. 

We deny responsibility for our bad behavior and lash out at anyone who tells us we're wrong. We act out, throw tantrums, riot, destroy our own communities, and then demand that white people be held accountable for our behavior. We demand that everyone respects us and accepts our bad behavior 100% of the time, or we label them racist.

By teaching our children that they shouldn't respect authority, we are sacrificing them for our own agenda, which is nothing but a means to behave however we want with no consequences. We want the authorities to respect us, but we don't want to respect the authorities.

Decades ago we were disenfranchised and treated poorly. Laws were changed, policies were enacted, social constructs were rearranged.

We still feel entitled to a free pass on unchecked behavior, legal and social irresponsibility, and our own brand of racism.

"I agree with the cause and have attended a protest, but I feel the methods need to be updated for the 21st century. Peaceful marches are all well and good, but a more concerted political and legal effort would be far more effective, e.g. ensuring that black people come out and vote for public officials that run on an anti-police brutality and anti-racism platform. The movement at present lacks leadership and direction.

 Also, some of the actions of the BLM movement only serve to discredit the movement as a whole. Though I think it's ridiculous that people will stop sympathising with murder victims because they were inconvenienced one time by a traffic jam, one has to acknowledge that racists will look for any reason to discredit a black empowerment movement.

Furthermore, it may be good to be more discerning as to the causes BLM protests for.

Honestly i might have an opinion that is not entirely favorable to the vast majority

So basically i feel that most of the racial profiling is due to this wierd apathetic sub culture within black culture and you have to have seen it if you live in America. Im talking about the type of ""pseudo gangster"" where the person is self centered and their own self is more important than the environment and the people around them. I have seen this way too much and i feel that its a lack of understanding and information that is causing this to happen.

Yes people are killed and we are currently doing working on it but the thing that i see around me and people who have the same skin color as me more or less has been pressuring me to be someone that i am not for my entire life. I have been pressurised into playing sports, (i dont like sports at all, but i am 6""4) i have been pressurised into abusing drugs(i dont have the slightest intent on getting hooked on weed to calm me down) i have been constantly picked on for listening to music other than Hip hop and R&B (i like alot of different styles of music ranging from Jrock to Modern classical music (like the piano guys or Lindsey Stirling) i have been recently picked on for TAKING APART COMPUTERS and repurposing the parts.","I am a 17 year old black male

Honestly i might have an opinion that is not entirely favorable to the vast majority

So basically i feel that most of the racial profiling is due to this wierd apathetic sub culture within black culture and you have to have seen it if you live in America Im talking about the type of pseudo gangster where the person is self centered and their own self is more important than the environment and the people around them I have seen this way too much and i feel that its a lack of understanding and information that is causing this to happen

Reparations aren't going to change the fact that police can shoot me while I'm unarmed and largely get away with it because there's always a segment that will always try to justify it to stay in their bubble of ignorance, privilege, and sense of supremacy

Reparations aren't going to change the fact that any serious discussion of race, I won't be taken seriously because I'll be accused of ""playing the race card"". 

Reparations aren't going to change the fact that I will *always* will be held to a double standard and that any deviation from what white america deems as ""normal"" or ""acceptable"", that somehow my actions will have my entire community judged unfairly.

I know BlackLivesMatter as a movement make some people uncomfortable. I don't mind. I think most things that are worth doing are uncomfortable or messy. The Civil Rights Movement wasn't some civilized garden party, where people went ""Oh, did you want more rights? Didn't realise, here you are."" 

I'm sure there were people - totally liberal, I'm-not-a-racist people - saying casually to their dining companions, ""I don't really get what all the fuss is about. I mean, front of the bus, back of the bus, you're getting a ride, isn't that the important part?""

People get really uncomfortable when we talk about race, when we ""make"" things about race. The fact is, we don't live in a post-racial society. Not by a long-shot.

While the system is set up in such way that colour-blind policies will end up disadvantaging certain groups disproportionately, one cannot say that we live in an equal-opportunity world.

We're humans. We're not going to get everything right. But I stand with BlackLivesMatter because I believe in the central message.

Personally, I think there is a big problem with the police brutality and profiling, and originally, I supported the Black Lives Matter movement. However, maybe for lack of leadership, maybe for lack of coherent message, the group has been getting so angry that their message is lost in the screaming.

I wouldn't go as far as calling it unproductive or counter-productive because the validity of their cause is so obvious and necessary that no amount of impertinence or lack of direction could tarnish the movement's necessity. It needs grown ups, it needs more sympathetic legislators, it needs better funding, it needs a public/permanent/accessible medium of communication etc etc etc..

All that being said, I'm glad it exists and I'm glad it showcases the racist idiocracy we live in, as proven by the droves of idiots screaming ""all lives matter"" into the wind. To a degree, it's a harmless outlet for a very frustrated portion of the population, better that than a militia, better that than vandalism etc... 

Finally, it needs more white people. Yes, I said it. No consequent change will occur until more whites realize the hell we live in and push for change, advocate for decency and fight the racists/bigots within their own ranks. The movement gets stronger as it diversifies. 

TL;DR: BLM isn't the best, but it's necessary, useful to a degree and ideally, can push for change in a more organized, meaningful way in the future.

I wouldnt go as far as calling it unproductive or counterproductive because the validity of their cause is so obvious and necessary that no amount of impertinence or lack of direction could tarnish the movements necessity It needs grown ups it needs more sympathetic legislators it needs better funding it needs a publicpermanentaccessible medium of communication etc etc etc

All that being said Im glad it exists and Im glad it showcases the racist idiocracy we live in as proven by the droves of idiots screaming all lives matter into the wind To a degree its a harmless outlet for a very frustrated portion of the population better that than a militia better that than vandalism etc 

Finally it needs more white people Yes I said it No consequent change will occur until more whites realize the hell we live in and push for change advocate for decency and fight the racistsbigots within their own ranks The movement gets stronger as it diversifies 

TLDR BLM isnt the best but its necessary useful to a degree and ideally can push for change in a more organized meaningful way in the future

""""" Do I have to say as a black man"" on this post? lol 

Anywaym Loud,  No clear leadership, but has the biggest platform due to media exposure. The 10 point manifesto helps. They do well but a lot of people try to undermine it. 

I find it hilarious that you have  racist, and white supremacy enabling Non-blacks saying it's a terror group, and getting all  antsy about people using their first amendment right against a government entity. 

Sure there are  some crazy black people using BLM as an excuse to throw Tailgate parties, preach a horrible message ( kill cops) and generally show up and act wild. That gets more media attention and fuels the fire. 

Lastly,

What Micah Johnson did was wrong, but no doubt the conditions  that made him think his actions were necessary, were both contributed by BLM or rather its  lack of impact, Media bias, Denial from the American populace, and Racism from you-know-who. Sad that it seemed to be the only way to get people to listen to the problem. "," Do I have to say as a black man on this post lol

"Taking pride in your nationality (Irish, Scottish, Greek, etc) is perfectly fine because you’re appreciating it’s culture and traditions that, for many people, are emotionally significant. Taking pride in being white, however, is not ok because “whiteness” has no culture or traditions to take pride in. There is nothing to be proud of except the race itself and what the societal implications of that race are. Often the only meaning behind it is a sense of social superiority, centuries of colonialism that cultivated said superiority, and feelings of nationalism despite being descended from immigrants. It’s kind of hard to explain, so I hope that makes sense. There’s some good articles online that should be pretty easy to find if you want to explore this further. 

Tldr; Being white is not bad, but it’s also not good. It’s meaningless, so there’s nothing to take pride in.

On a more serious note, it’s probably better to go to google with these kind of questions rather than Reddit, as it will give you credible sources you can trust as opposed to information given to you by some rando (such as myself!) which is harder to verify.

"In case you are sincere in your question, the distraction is because you are mistaking race and culture.  Whiteness is not a culture, and it is certainly nothing to be proud of, as it only exists to justify oppression of non-white people.  The black identity, because of racial oppression, has its own culture, even though it was forced upon people against their will, and therefore being black is something one can be proud of.   As a more general rule, any argument or question that amounts to ""why is it OK for non-white people to do this but not white people?"" is invalid, because it presupposes white and non-white are symmetric concepts.  But they are not.  Systematic racism oppresses non-white people not white people.  It's OK to be white.  And it's OK to proud of your cultural heritage.

"If she really did park in the road (blocking it) with her car and yell for around 30 minutes, that could easily be considered public disturbance or a similar crime if not more, depending on the jurisdiction. Trespassing is a crime. And we can only assume that her charging at the man is to commit assault which is also a crime. Even if it’s only to take the hose out of his hands and drop it, that’s still assault in multiple jurisdictions if she touches him in the process.

And while the clip is funny which makes it easy to not take seriously: she’s furious, is now being sprayed with water, and is falling which is only making her angrier. So she could very realistically choose to go further than simply taking the hose if given the opportunity.

While 911 might not be the best number to call compared to non-emergency at this point, I don’t think it would be unreasonable to call 911 due to the crimes already present and fear that the situation could escalate.","If she really did park in the road blocking it with her car and yell for around 30 minutes that could easily be considered public disturbance or a similar crime if not more depending on the jurisdiction Trespassing is a crime And we can only assume that her charging at the man is to commit assault which is also a crime Even if it’s only to take the hose out of his hands and drop it that’s still assault in multiple jurisdictions if she touches him in the process

"I agree about the racial divide shit, but what do you consider ""their fair share?""

I ask because there is much talk of taking from the rich and I haven't completely been sold on this idea. I am not poor, I am not rich. I think I would be considered lower middle class.

Maybe even upper, upper middle class. There's no guarantee though and I will have to seriously bust my ass to get there. It is not a unique job, doesn't require any special education and is probably something almost anyone can do. I saw the difference in my net and gross pay before because of taxes so I can only imagine what it will be like if I am able to get myself up there.

"It depends what type of gun and in what state it’s carried. 

For example most revolvers have the option of being fired “double action” - that is, pulling the trigger both cocks the hammer AND releases it to strike the round. These are normally carried with a round in the chamber, but uncocked. 

Due to the trigger pull having to do two separate actions, it’s a heavy pull - hard to do accidentally, so double-action revolvers rarely need a dedicated safety. 

Other revolvers are “single-action” (getting rarer these days). In these, the revolver must be cocked, THEN fired. In these you have the option of either carrying cocked, with a manual safety, OR carrying uncocked, in which case you don’t need a safety. 

It’s a similar logic with many autoloaders. Autoloaders are typically carried with a round in the chamber, and with EITHER a manual safety, OR an internal hammer decocked or at half-cock, to lengthen the trigger pull so you don’t need a safety. 

Some people prefer to carry with an empty chamber, in which case a safety catch is completely unnecessary as it’s basically impossible to rack the slide of an autoloader by accident.  

Many guns (especially autoloaders) have “grip safeties” built into the grip (no kidding) so if your hand isn’t pressing them, the trigger is disconnected. Meaning if the trigger snags on something in the holster etc, it won’t go off. 

Finally, no safety catch is as effective as learning and performing correct trigger discipline, and following the other rules of gun safety, the most important being: 

All guns are always loaded, ESPECIALLY when you know they aren’t loaded, and

Never point a gun at anything you don’t wish to destroy, and wouldn’t be comfortable to admitting killing in court. 

Hope this helps. Sure I missed something, but there you go. 

Oh also, in some jurisdictions and/or professions, limitations on how you can carry may exist, for example not being able to carry with a round in the chamber.","It depends what type of gun and in what state it’s carried

"A lot modern handguns like Sigs or Glocs lack manual safeties for a lot of reasons, but mostly because they are antiquated and also because of what was mentioned above with ""life or death"" situations. 

They are antiquated because we have progressed handgun technology to the point where the amount of extra safety you would get is a diminishing return (with proper trigger discipline) and the safety would just get in the way when you need to fire. The main reason for safeties on auto-loading handguns historically was actually to prevent things like the gun firing while racking the slide (slam fire), or when the gun is dropped (although negligent trigger pull was a major reason, it wasn't the main reason). For example, Glocks and other modern handguns without safeties have something called a ""firing pin block"". This part of the handgun makes it virtually impossible for a handgun to fire from being dropped or slammed, because the firing pin will have nowhere to go. Also, Glocks/Sigs nowadays have triggers that are much harder to pull than traditional handguns, significantly reducing the chance that the trigger gets bumped and the gun goes off. It's extremely unlikely that any Glock would fire while in a holster. 

I hope this clears things up and also that it was educational.

"On many handguns you can buy either the manual safety version, or the one without (to answer your question that's no alternative, just nothing). California and some other states require manual safeties, so a fair amount of guns  come in both flavors.  


That being said, handguns without safeties certainly seem to be more popular. Most handgun owners believe they don't need a safety. They say, ""The only safety they need is between their ears."" They believe that being able to draw and shoot quickly is more important than having an extra safety device.   


And besides manual safeties, handguns do have other kinds of safeties in them to help prevent accidents and negligent discharge. For example, most (if not all) modern handguns are drop safe. That is, they will not shoot if dropped (contrary to what movies would have you believe). Also, many handguns have trigger safeties that make it much harder for a trigger to activate if it is caught on a stick or some clothing. It requires the full even pressure of a finger to activate. Revolvers also have a safety that prevents their hammer from contacting the primer and shooting the gun, even if the hammer is hit forcefully from behind (old guns did not have this and you had to carry with one chamber empty to be safe).","On many handguns you can buy either the manual safety version or the one without to answer your question thats no alternative just nothing California and some other states require manual safeties so a fair amount of guns  come in both flavors

While I'm not against safety's I am against the mentality ""all guns should"". Certain ""common sense"" features, such as a loaded chamber indicator, can add a sense of security that encourages people to pay less attention to safety rules. In the case of a loaded chamber indicator these features can actually be dangerous in life or death situations.

Many states do not require any testing nor demonstration of proficiency with arms to get a license, passing a background check and having the money to pay for the license is generally all that is required. Of the states that require a proficiency test, it is usually little more than a demonstration showing that one can safely handle the firearm and hit a target is all that is required. The safety courses required generally are less than 3 hours in length. It actually takes more study to get a drivers license than to get a concealed carry license.
