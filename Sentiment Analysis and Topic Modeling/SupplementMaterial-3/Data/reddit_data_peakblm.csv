"Guess you’ve never heard of drug dealers or cartels then. 

Firearms will never be an issue of the firearm in and of itself allowing someone to exert power in a way others disagree with. The problem is the human condition. The tool is irrelevant. If a human being seeks to cause harm, they will figure out a way to do it. 

In other cultures and societies blanket bans on firearms may be the reality, but to say that ALSO “violent crime” is at 0% or virtually non-existent is absurd.","Guess you’ve never heard of drug dealers or cartels then

"It generally does not take a professional coroner to tell the difference between a lynching and a suicide hanging. 

Close to 100% of lynchings are preceded by a struggle and/or a beating, meaning that the victim would have serious, obvious defensive wounds.

Also, as one of the police spokesman mentioned, the ropes were both *tied* to a high branch, while lynchings are almost always done by the victim being *hoisted* by their killers.

Just imagine the logistics of subduing a grown man *without tying him up*, getting a rope around his neck, *carrying* him up a tree, and pushing him off. All without causing any defensive wounds, and without him getting your DNA under his nails, and without anyone noticing. It is fantastically unlikely.

It's a good policy to wait and let the coroner declare cause of death, but it's not suspicious at all for the police to be comfortable saying these look like suicides, to dispel all this talk about lynchings.

As far as them be so close in distance and time, look up the copycat phenomenon, which is common in both murders and suicides.","It generally does not take a professional coroner to tell the difference between a lynching and a suicide hanging

Malcolm:

(2) was hanging by a USB cord, which could not have held him for long

Robert:

What I want to know is... how does someone go about hanging themselves? Morbid but serious - in movies, they stand on a chair, tie the rope to the ceiling, and then kick the chair out from under them. They tend to die by strangulation (in TV shows, some people can be saved if you get to them fast enough).

The old Hanging method had the floor drop from below them, hopefully breaking their neck for a quick death or they would die by strangulation.

So, these men did what? Climbed into the tree, tied the rope (or USB cord 🙄) to the branch and their neck, and then jumped? 


That just doesn’t seem likely. Why a tree near a government building? Robert went to a BLM protest a few days prior; would he have done this to bring awareness to the movement? I honestly don’t think so. If he had done it as a hardcore protest (like the people who set themselves on fire), he should have left a note or worn a BLM shirt... 

And Malcolm had made plans to hang out with his kids - suicidal people tend not to make future plans (that and giving their stuff away are usually signs to look for if you’re concerned for a friend). 

Not to mention the KKK has a hold in the area....","So

Neither man is described as having defensive wounds.

There's absolutely no reason evidence to suggest that these were lynchings.

It is much more likely that Mr. Harsch copied Mr. Fuller, which is a common enough phenomenon, than that there is an active lynch mob in liberal Southern California with the uncommon abilities it would take to pull off two lynchings with no signs of a struggle.

>People will always look for confirmation of their beliefs, so being able to counter false beliefs is of the highest importance imo. Not stating that I think the family is wrong of course. I just want them to have their answers for justice

As a society as a whole I think that making actions on belief is a terrible idea (just look at religion historically) and that the reason our society's today are becoming better is because religion is loosing influence and we're starting to hold facts at their regard allowing for a fair and just system.

Obviously the system isn't perfect but it's improving and that's because acting on information is substantially more effective than acting on belief.

The family could easily have good reason to believe they weren't suicidal if they find evidence of resist then let's prosecute those who are guilty. As I stated earlier though the logistical skill to pull of these crimes with zero signs of resistance are astronomically low so if foul play is involved we'd likely find out soon.","My point is that in times of racial crises people tend to look for martyrs Which is a good thing if its just

"No it doesn't mean that someone has power over you. It simply means someone has an advantage. But its even bigger than just an advantage. For example children of wealthy people are called privileged because they have opportunities poor people don't have. Like quitting their jobs or asking for a higher wage without having to fear losing their only source of income. Or having acces to health care and education other people cant afford.White privilege simply refers to the way how white people are generally treated better than blacks by society. There are countless studies showing for example that people of color are punished harder for the same crime than whites. Or that white people with the same qualifications as black people get picked for a job more often.However this can result in someone having power over you. There are many examples of white people getting in an argument with minorities and they are threatening to call the police. Because they know that the police is biased towards minorities and in case of doubt will decide on behalf of the white person. They know about the many cases of racist police brutality and know that black people are afraid to be murdered by the cops just for being black.

I'm not a lawyer but a quick google lookup leads me to believe that in the state where she and her husband live charges can be brought against them for menacing with a firearm, which is a felony. This is due to the way both of them were brandishing their weapons, pointing them at the protesters with fingers on triggers, etc.  
There were mitigating factors, such as the fact that the protestors broke the door of the gated community where they were living, so if it went to trial it may not be super simple to convict them. That, along with their legal connections within the state, their money and also their race is likely why the DA is not bringing up charges (that I know of ) against them.","I dont think that in this incident there were any cops around at least I didnt see any in the video Had they pointed the guns at cops I believe the situation would have changed rapidly or instantly for the worse as police have a habit of shooting first and acting second and tend to shoot even quicker against blacks and minorities which I think was the point of this post

"The land may actually belong to the trustees of Portland Place. There's been a three year legal dispute between them and the McCloskeys over it. Also kinda weird how the McCloskeys claim the protestors were aggressive when three dozen of their neighbors signed a letter in support of the protestors and condemned the actions of the McCloskeys. The McCloskeys won't even answer whether there's video surveillance.

State v Whipple also had a judgement stating that just because someone doesn't have a duty to retreat doesn't allow for use of deadly force, and that the first two sections of the castle doctrine are related to someone attempting to enter your home.

There's too much questionable stuff about the situation to take the McCloskeys at their word, especially given the video. Some want to take them at their word, I see someone attempting to set up a legal defense so they don't get charged with brandishing a deadly weapon. They described the protestors coming in akin to the storming of the Bastille.

Short and simple, it does matter whether they broke in because that changes whether or not it's legal for them to be pointing guns at people. You can't just go point a gun at someone for walking across your property or near your property. You have to have a reason to firmly believe your life is in danger.","The land may actually belong to the trustees of Portland Place Theres been a three year legal dispute between them and the McCloskeys over it Also kinda weird how the McCloskeys claim the protestors were aggressive when three dozen of their neighbors signed a letter in support of the protestors and condemned the actions of the McCloskeys The McCloskeys wont even answer whether theres video surveillance

[“All men are created equal” is part of The Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_men_are_created_equal)


The contradiction between the claim that ""all men are created equal"" and the existence of American slavery, including Thomas Jefferson himself owning slaves, attracted comment when the Declaration of Independence was first published. Before final approval, Congress, having made a few alterations to some of the wording, also deleted nearly a fourth of the draft, including a passage criticizing the slave trade. At that time many other members of Congress also owned slaves, which clearly factored into their decision to delete the controversial ""anti-slavery"" passage. Jefferson believed adding such a passage would dissolve the independence movement.[citation needed] Jefferson, decades before the Declaration of Independence, argued in court for the abolition of a slave.[clarification needed] The court dismissed the case outright. In writing the declaration, Jefferson believed the phrase ""all men are created equal"" to be self-evident, and would ultimately resolve slavery.[19] In 1776, abolitionist Thomas Day wrote: ""If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, signing resolutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandishing a whip over his affrighted slaves.""[19]

Similarly there is a contradiction between the phrase that ""all men are created equal"" and the idea that all people, women as well as men, had and have rights. Other thinkers, for example the French revolutionary Nicolas de Condorcet, later corrected this.","ACTUALLY God never said all men are equalhttpswwwchristianitytodaycomct2016novemberbibleneversaysallmenarecreatedequalhtml

"I’m from the U.K. but spend quite a bit of time in the USA so I have no skin in the politics of this. I’ll give a specific example from an outsiders perspective. 

The police in the United States are more than just police. Unlike in most countries on the planet including both of ours, mental health issues and other contributing to public disorder do not have skilled public agencies to deal with them in the United States. 

In the good ol’ US of A, many of those issues are dealt with by 911 calls because there is no wider support net, no-one else to call, no-one else to help. Therefore, police funding increases because they themselves are sent to deal with issues that are not by any normal measure a police incident. 

Moreover, they are working day to day with a heavily armed population, meaning someone acting irrationally because of a mental break often gets treated the same way as a cracked out guy with a gun. This is partly for the above reasons, heavily influenced by a lack of training and resource. The money the police get is increasingly is going toward arming them with escalating grades of military weaponry, as a one-size fits all solution to public disorder. 

The call to defund the police is not to defund ALL of the police. It isn’t a call for no police. It isn’t a call to disband. Nobody is arguing for that. The intent behind the defund statement is that policing should be by consent, they should have a narrow and limited remit of upholding the law. 

Everything else needs to be dealt with appropriately, and in almost every case that isn’t sending a team of heavily armed trigger happy authority figures to deal with minor disputes. Add in the ‘Karen’ factor of false police calls against people of colour, a default assumption of malicious intent, and the gross disrespect for human life that permeates the American culture (another issue we don’t have time for today) in favour of 2nd amendment rights and you have the perfect storm. 

Defund the police. 
Provide them with limited funding and appropriate training and weapon art to de-escalate situations. Use the money from defunding and redirect those billions of dollars spent on weapons of war leveraged against the population and instead invest in the complex tools and services that imperfect human beings need, instead of buying guns to offer a quick and permanent solution to a myriad of problems.","I’m from the UK but spend quite a bit of time in the USA so I have no skin in the politics of this I’ll give a specific example from an outsiders perspective

Moreover they are working day to day with a heavily armed population meaning someone acting irrationally because of a mental break often gets treated the same way as a cracked out guy with a gun This is partly for the above reasons heavily influenced by a lack of training and resource The money the police get is increasingly is going toward arming them with escalating grades of military weaponry as a onesize fits all solution to public disorder 

The call to defund the police is not to defund ALL of the police It isn’t a call for no police It isn’t a call to disband Nobody is arguing for that The intent behind the defund statement is that policing should be by consent they should have a narrow and limited remit of upholding the law 

Everything else needs to be dealt with appropriately and in almost every case that isn’t sending a team of heavily armed trigger happy authority figures to deal with minor disputes Add in the ‘Karen’ factor of false police calls against people of colour a default assumption of malicious intent and the gross disrespect for human life that permeates the American culture another issue we don’t have time for today in favour of 2nd amendment rights and you have the perfect storm 

Defund the police 
Provide them with limited funding and appropriate training and weapon art to deescalate situations Use the money from defunding and redirect those billions of dollars spent on weapons of war leveraged against the population and instead invest in the complex tools and services that imperfect human beings need instead of buying guns to offer a quick and permanent solution to a myriad of problems",17,11,0.002403846153846154,0.002403846153846154
"The problem is that we’ve tried deescalation and unconscious bias training for the police in a number of cities and it’s gotten us nowhere. The people who are calling for defunding are recognizing that reform has not worked so now it’s time to put our money elsewhere or completely start over with how we think about crime & punishment in this country. I could talk about this all day but one thing to think about is that anything and everything you call 911 for results in police showing up, which many times is not necessary. People dealing with drug addiction, homelessness, mental health crises, etc all end up interacting with the police who do nothing to help them at the end of the day because they aren’t trained for solutions other than to arrest, in my opinion. We’d be much better off sending people specialized in these areas to provide resources/support and that requires shifting funding to those other programs.",The problem is that we’ve tried deescalation and unconscious bias training for the police in a number of cities and it’s gotten us nowhere The people who are calling for defunding are recognizing that reform has not worked so now it’s time to put our money elsewhere or completely start over with how we think about crime  punishment in this country I could talk about this all day but one thing to think about is that anything and everything you call 911 for results in police showing up which many times is not necessary People dealing with drug addiction homelessness mental health crises etc all end up interacting with the police who do nothing to help them at the end of the day because they aren’t trained for solutions other than to arrest in my opinion We’d be much better off sending people specialized in these areas to provide resourcessupport and that requires shifting funding to those other programs,13,9,0.006289308176100629,0.0
"Let me first clarify I’m from the UK so I’m a bit lost on most of the defunding ideas. 
When you say defund do you mean simply have more control of what the police spend their budgets on - weaponry, training etc or do you mean simply get rid of them? 
Also if a complaint is made of a police officer is there any sort of public inquiry or is it the police simply policing the police?
I have a million questions as what we see over here doesn’t always make BLM protest look good and I just want to understand certain issues.","Let me first clarify I’m from the UK so I’m a bit lost on most of the defunding ideas

"Yes, but there’s a requirement to identify yourself in some states even if there’s no requirement to provide ID. Also, IANAL

In some states there is a statutory requirement that person(s) identify themselves during an investigative detention. However that request for identity must be supported by a valid Terry stop (I.e they must be suspected of criminal activity and that suspicion must be supported by reasonable suspicion). Also, even in those situations you’re not allowed to arrest someone for failing to produce identification.

The two most fucked up parts this situation are (IMO):

1. What was their reasonable suspicion of criminal activity based on? On never mind he’s a black man in America! (Mandatory /s)

2. Another commenter above made a good point.

“I just learned of #ElijahMcClain. I cannot handle his story. His volunteering to play violin at an animal shelter to calm the animals speaks to a kind, young, compassionate man. His violent death in August 2019, at the hands of Aurora PD after a carotid choke hold and the pressure on his chest caused this 23 year old man to vomit, and the paramedics who responded to the call and per guidance from the PO, administered ketamine due to his agitated state. He suffered two cardiac arrests in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.

All three responding officers miraculously had their camera fall off during the call. Their audio still worked. During the call, while applying the carotid choke hold, the officer is heard telling another officer who was picking one of the cameras, “Move the camera, dude.” He intentionally was avoiding being caught on camera doing what he was doing. Because the audio worked, we have Elijah’s last statements to the police.”

"Can we have a conversation about the phrase ""suspicious activity"" or ""suspicious person""?  


I have been thinking about this case for days..and we can all agree everything that happened is bad. But the root of it getting as far as it did, is that stupid 911 call. I keep asking myself if we can blame the caller. What would I do? What should I do?  


I feel really compelled to try to change the narrative about ""suspicious person"" calls.  


Can anyone here come up with a situation that they feel a ""suspicious person"" call is actually necessary? I can't.

If you saw them harming someone...say ""The person hit this other person""
